To setup a discord you first need to create an application (basically a bot), here are the steps to follow:

1. Visit [Discord Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications 'Discord Application')
2. Cick on "New Application" Button

12. Copy and paste that URL in browser, a prompt will come up where it will ask you to select you own "Discord Server"

13. Once you add the Bot into your server, copy the "Server Id", by right clicking on the server avatar. Now place this id in `.env` against _GUILD_ID_

# Connecting Discord Service with Discord

Now as you have created the discord bot, now its time to connect it with discord service using the following steps:

1. You would need to register the commands first. That will be auto handled once you start the server
2. Now start the server using

```bash
   make run #or go run .
```

3. For IP tunneling, need to run NGROK, use the following command

```bash
   make ngrok #or ngrok http 8999
```

Since we are considering 8999 as default port for this service. If you wish to change it you can change it in `Makefile` & in `docker-compose.yml`

4. Copy the Ngrok URL and open the General Information on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) of your bot, paste the copied URL in Interactions Endpoint URL

5. All Set ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€. Now you can start with running hello command
